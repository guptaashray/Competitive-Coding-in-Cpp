The Object of Your Affection
Your friend is building a new match-making service: The Object of Your Affection or OOYA for short (don’t worry, you still have time to convince them to change the name).

With your new understanding of C++ objects and classes, your friend thought you could build a pretty well-organized system of dating profiles.

Your first step? Build a Profile class that allows users to generate profile objects.

The Profile should store the following information:

User’s name
User’s age
User’s city
User’s country
User’s pronouns
User’s hobbies
And this is how users should be able to interact with their own profiles:

Create a new profile with some information
Add hobbies
View profile
