LOGICAL OPERATORS
Logical Operator: &&
The and logical operator is denoted by &&.

It returns true if the condition on the left and the condition on the right are both true. Otherwise, it returns false.

Here’s the truth table:

a	b	a && b
false	false	false
false	true	false
true	false	false
true	true	true

For instance:

( 1 < 2 && 2 < 3 ) returns true
( 1 < 2 && 2 > 3 ) returns false
Note: The keyword and can also be used in the place of &&.

Logical Operator: II
The or logical operator is denoted by ||.

It returns true when the condition on the left is true or the condition on the right is true. Only one of them needs to be true.

Here’s the truth table:

a	b	a || b
false	false	false
false	true	true
true	false	true
true	true	true

For instance:

( 1 < 2 || 2 > 3 ) returns true
( 1 > 2 || 2 > 3 ) returns false
Note: The keyword or can be used in the place of ||.

Logical Operator: !
The not logical operator is denoted by !.

It reverses the bool outcome of the expression that immediately follows.

Here’s the truth table:

a	!a
false	true
true	false

For instance:

( !true ) returns false
( !false ) returns true
( !(10 < 11) ) returns false
Note: The keyword not can be used in the place of !.
