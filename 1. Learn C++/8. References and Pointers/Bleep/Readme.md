Bleep
“You don’t have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them.” - Ray Bradbury 

Congratulations on your new job at the Department of Re-education! You have been tasked with building an algorithm that can bleep out any words deemed unsavory by the powers that be.

Write a bleep.cpp program that “bleeps” any word that’s passed in. You’ll test this out with "broccoli", which has been recently banned by the Department.

Turn some text like "I'm rolling up my broccoli" into "I'm rolling up my ********".

Make sure to use pass-by-reference in your functions so you can modify the incoming text!
