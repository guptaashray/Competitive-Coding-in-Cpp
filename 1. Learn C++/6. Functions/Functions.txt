FUNCTIONS
Built-in Functions
Before we learn how to create functions, let’s go over some built-in functions…

C++ comes chock-full of functions that are already created as part of the standard library. But how do we access this hidden hoard of helpful functions? We gain access to various functions by including headers like <cmath> or <string>.

In fact, you may already have used a couple functions without even knowing it! With the following header:

#include <cmath>
We gain the power to call sqrt() to find the square root of any number.

Wait, “call” sqrt()?

Calling a function is how we get a function to take action. To call a basic function, we just need the function name followed by a pair of parentheses like sqrt(9). For example:

std::cout << sqrt(9) << "\n";

// This would output 3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Inside of main(), call rand() with the modulo operator to generate a random number between 0 and your favorite number. For example, rand() % 29 would output a random number between 0 and 28.

// This seeds the random number generator:
  srand (time(NULL));
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Declare & Define
Often, built-in functions aren’t enough to tackle the wide array of programming challenges out there. But never fear: you can write your own functions too!

A C++ function is comprised of two distinct parts:

Declaration: this includes the function’s name, what the return type is, and any parameters (if the function will accept input values, known as arguments).
Definition: also known as the body of the function, this contains the instructions for what the function is supposed to do.
This is the overall structure:

return_type function_name( any, parameters, you, have ) {

   // Code block here

   return output_if_there_is_any;

}
This is what it might look like with real code:

void make_sandwich() {

  std::cout << "bread\n";
  std::cout << "egg\n";
  std::cout << "cheese\n";
  std::cout << "avocado\n";
  std::cout << "bread\n";

}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Return Types — Beyond the Void
When you do in fact want your function to return something and pass information back to the rest of your program, C++ has you covered. Just like there are many variable types, there are many different return types for functions.

A function can return most data types we’ve covered, including double, int, bool, char, std::string, and std::vector.

std::string always_blue() {

  return "blue!\n";

}
Note: The return statement is the last line of code that a function will execute. For example:

std::string always_blue() {

  return "blue!\n";

  std::cout << "Returned blue!";

}
The final line will not execute because a value has already been returned. So "Returned blue!" won’t be printed to the terminal.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How Return Values Work
When functions have a return type other than void, the function has two new requirements:

There must be a value returned from the function.
The return value must be the same type as the function’s return type.
But where does the return value get returned to?

It gets returned to the place where the function is called. For example, if you have the following function:

std::string feed_the_cat() {

  return "Cat is fed!";

}
And then print the function call inside of main():

int main() {

  std::string cat_message = feed_the_cat();
  std::cout << cat_message;

}
The return value of the function is what gets printed to the terminal.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Parameters & Arguments
Returning data is all well and good, but let’s say you’re visiting NYC and you’ve been told that New Yorkers usually add a 20% tip for restaurants and taxis. It would be really convenient if you could just build a function that accepted different prices as input and figured out how much you should tip.

As it happens, you can do that with parameters. Parameters (sometimes called formal parameters) are variables used in a function’s definition. They act as placeholders for the input values you’ll use during your function call.

parameters vs arguments
In the function below, price is the function’s parameter and it’s a double. It is declared between the parentheses and then used in the body of the function.

double get_tip(double price) {

  return price * 0.2;

}
Then, when you’re ready to use your function, the value you pass to the function is called an argument (also known as an actual parameter). In this case, 15.75 is the argument that is passed to the function:

double tip = get_tip(15.75);
// tip would be 3.15
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tackling Multiple Arguments
Hang on, you may be thinking, are you limited to one parameter per function? Not at all! You can add as many as you like, but you will have to remember their order when you call the function.

double get_tip(double price, double tip, bool total_included) {

  if (total_included) {

    return price * tip + price;

  } else {

    return price * tip;

  }

}
So here we have three parameters:

double price
double tip
bool total_included
When calling get_tip(), it’s important to call it with price first, tip second, and return_total last:

get_tip(0.25, true, 45.50);
// this code will not work
get_tip(45.50, 0.25, true);
// this code results in 56.875, which you could round up to 56.88
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How Parameters & Arguments Work
A function with parameters has a couple of requirements:

The function call must include the same number of arguments as there are parameters.
The corresponding arguments must be passed in the same order.
By calling a function with arguments, you are telling a function, “Hey function, when you execute, use these values where you have parameters in your definition.”

While it executes, anywhere the function comes across a parameter, it replaces the parameter with the corresponding argument you gave it.

Review of C++ Functions
Wow! Check out all you’ve learned about C++ functions:

-A function is a named group of statements that do something together.
-Functions allow you to create more flexible, modular, and DRY code.
-C++ has many built-in functions that you can use.
-Functions are called like function_name();
-A function has a declaration with a return type and possible parameters.
-A function has a definition (or body) with a group of statements and a possible return value.
void functions do not have return values.
-Functions with a return value have return statements.
-Parameters are variables used as placeholders for function input values.
-Arguments are a function’s actual input values.
-You now know enough C++ to create some pretty cool projects on your own. But, as you’ll see, there are still many ways to improve your code.
