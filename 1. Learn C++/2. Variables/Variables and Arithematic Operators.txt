VARIABLES
Introduction to Variables
The "Hello World!" program simply writes to the screen. It does not read anything, calculate anything, or allow for user input. That’s no fun!

Real programs tend to produce results based on some input that the user of the program gives, rather than just outputting the same thing every time.

To read something from the keyboard, we first need somewhere in the computer’s memory to store data. That is where variables come in.

A variable is simply a name that represents a particular piece of your computer’s memory that has been set aside for you to store, retrieve, and use data.

In this lesson, we will learn about some of the basic data types:

int: integer numbers
double: floating-point numbers
char: individual characters
string: a sequence of characters
bool: true/false values

Every variable has a type, which represents the kind of information you can store inside of it. It tells your compiler how much memory to set aside for the variable, and it defines what you can do with the variable.

Arithmetic Operators
Computers are incredible at doing calculations. Now that we have declared variables, let’s use them with arithmetic operators to calculate things!

Here are some arithmetic operators:

+ addition
- subtraction
* multiplication
/ division
% modulo (divides and gives the remainder)
