VARIABLES
Chaining
Now that we have outputted a variable and have also outputted things using multiple couts. Let’s take a closer look at cout again.

If we have the code below:

int age = 28;

std::cout << "Hello, I am ";
std::cout << age;
std::cout << " years old\n";
It will output:

Hello, I am 28 years old
Notice how we use quotes around the characters in "Hello, I am " but not in age.

We use quotes when we want a literal string.
We don’t use quotes when we refer to the value of something with a name (like a variable).
So now, is it possible to write the cout statements within a single line?

Yep! You can use multiple << operators to chain the things you want to output.

For the same code above you can also do:

int age = 28;

std::cout << "Hello, I am " << age << " years old\n";
This is called chaining.
