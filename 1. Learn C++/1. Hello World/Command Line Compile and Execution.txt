COMPILE & EXECUTE
Compile and Execute

Compile: A computer can only understand machine code. A compiler can translate the C++ programs that we write into machine code. To compile a file, you need to type g++ followed by the file name in the terminal:

g++ hello.cpp
The compiler will then translate the C++ program hello.cpp and create a machine code file called a.out.

Execute: To execute the new machine code file, all you need to do is type ./ and the machine code file name in the terminal:

./a.out
The executable file will then be loaded to computer memory and the computer’s CPU (Central Processing Unit) executes the program one instruction at a time.

Compile and Execute (Naming Executables)
Compile: Sometimes when we compile, we want to give the output executable file a specific name. To do so, the compile command is slightly different. We still need to write g++ and the file name in the terminal. After that, there should be -o and then the name that you want to give to the executable file:

g++ hello.cpp -o hello
The compiler will then translate the C++ program hello.cpp and create a machine code file called hello.

Execute: To execute the new machine code file, all you need to do is type ./ and the machine code file name in the terminal:

./hello
The executable file will then be loaded to computer memory and the computer’s CPU will execute the program one instruction at a time.
