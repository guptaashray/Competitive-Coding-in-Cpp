Fizz Buzz
Fizz Buzz is a classic developer interview question that is asked or referred to so often for so long, it is almost a clich√©!

Though this challenge will appear very simplistic to those with some coding experience, it is designed to weed out 99.5% programming job candidates who cannot creatively use their coding knowledge to solve simple problems.

Want to give it a shot?

Fizz Buzz
Write a fizzbuzz.cpp program that outputs numbers from 1 to 100.

But for multiples of 3, print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of 5, print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both 3 and 5 print, FizzBuzz.

# include <iostream>
int main(){
  for (int i=1; i<=100; i++)
  {
    if(i%3==0 && i%5==0){
      std::cout<<"FizzBuzz\n";
    }
    else if (i%3==0){
      std::cout<<"Fizz\n";
    }
    else if(i%5==0){
      std::cout<<"Buzz\n";
    }
    else{
      std::cout <<i<<"\n";
    }
  }
}
